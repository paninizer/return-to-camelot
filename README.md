<h1>Return to Camelot</h1>
  
 A game set in the epilogue of the King Arthur myths, a turn based combat takes you through a dungeon-like environment. No graphics, just console fun!
 Aight nothing much more to be said, now to the installation/run guide.
 
 <h2>Install/Run on Eclipse</h2>
 
 Go to [Eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/2023-06/R/eclipse-java-2023-06-R-win32-x86_64.zip) to download the latest Java compiler.
 
 Create a new java project, then create a new package underneath called unit_16_to_18 (or just any package, then quickly fix the errors by clicking on suggestions and fix them later).
 
 Copy the files into the src directory of that project (/src/[project name]). Run and enjoy!
